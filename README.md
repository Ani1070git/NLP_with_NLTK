# NLP_with_NLTK
This repository contains practical implementations of essential text processing techniques using **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit) in Python. The focus is on understanding and applying basic NLP concepts through real-world examples.  

### Key Topics Covered  

1. **Tokenization and Basic Terminologies**  
   - Breaking text into individual words or sentences (tokens).  

2. **Text Preprocessing: Stemming**  
   - Reducing words to their root forms using algorithms like Porter Stemmer.  

3. **Text Preprocessing: Lemmatization**  
   - Transforming words to their dictionary form (lemmas) using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer.  

4. **Stopwords Removal**  
   - Filtering out common words (like "the", "is") that do not contribute significantly to the text's meaning.  

5. **Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging**  
   - Identifying grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb) for each word in a text.  

6. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
   - Extracting and categorizing entities (e.g., names, dates, locations) from the text.
